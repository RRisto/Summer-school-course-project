This is [VU](http://www.vu.nl/en/ "http://www.vu.nl/en/") Amsterdam Summer School course "Big Data in Society" final project. It is about analyzing how NY Times articles, Twitter and Facebook feed topics differrelated to shootings/killings in Dallas, Louisiana and Minnesota in July 2016. Visualisations are [here](http://rristo.github.io/start.html "http://rristo.github.io/start.html").

Legend:
- [Article](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/BLM/BLM.pdf "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/BLM/BLM.pdf") for which the analysis was done.
- [Analysis.R](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/Analysis.R "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/Analysis.R") - contains code for main analysis and data cleaning. Didn't set seed, so getting exactly same results is complicated (but results should not be very different!)
- [NYT.R](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/NYT.R "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/NYT.R") - code for getting data NYT API and scraping articles bodies from NYT
- [facebook.R](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/facebook.R "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/facebook.R") - code for geting articles of NYT facebook page and sorting out relevant articles which comments are used for analysis
- [twitterAPI.R](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/twitterAPI.R "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/twitterAPI.R") - code for collecting data NYT twitter account. As you get data from Twitter max 10 days in past, you cannot collect same data (unless somebody has stored it)
- [helpers.R](https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/helpers.R "https://github.com/RRisto/Summer-school-course-project/blob/master/helpers.R") - helper functions for analysis and data collection

Code is ugly (we were in a hurry in this project), but it works :)
